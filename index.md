### Neighborhood Ranking

The three most desirable features of Brooklyn that we decided on are: transit access, greenery or shade, and safety. Transit access allows the neighborhood to be extremely accessable with the trains, buses, and subways. Bushwick has access to the J, Z, L, and M trains. The M and L trains both stop at the Myrtle/Wyckoff Ave station. The J, M and Z trains all stop at the Myrtle Ave/Broadway station as well. Greenery and shade makes outdoor dining more comfortable and appealing. In Bushwick, some of the streets with restaurants and bars are lined with trees, which gives them a lot of shade for outdoor dining. Where there are no trees, there are all different types of prominent street art, providing most areas with a wonderful backdrop. This ambience and the safety level in Bushwick may partially explain the high level of outdoor seating approvals for the Bushwick restaurant applications, as shown below. \

The abundance of restaurants and bars, known to be very LGBTQ+ friendly,  allowed Bushwick to develop into a safe neighborhood for everyone . Bushwick does happen to rank quite low at the 52nd safest neighborhood in NYC because of certain areas. However, the area has improved tremendously since the peak of its crime rate. Bushwick is rated 2nd for public transit, but it ranks last overall compared to the other four neighborhoods.
